### 1. CheckOddEven (if-else): Write a program called CheckOddEven which prints "Odd Number" if the int variable “number” is odd, or “Even Number” otherwise. The program shall always print “BYE!” before exiting.

``` Hints: n is an even number if (n % 2) is 0; otherwise, it is an odd number.```

_if-else_

## 2. Write a Java method to check whether the nunber is prime number or not

``` Hint:
Ancient Greek mathematicians like Euclid and Eratosthenes (around 300-200 BC) had developed many algorithms (or step-by-step instructions) to work on prime numbers. By definition, a prime is a positive integer that is divisible by one and itself only.

To test whether a number x is a prime number, we could apply the definition by dividing x by 2, 3, 4, ..., up to x-1. If no divisor is found, then x is a prime number. Since divisors come in pair, there is no need to try all the factors until x-1, but up to √x. 
```

### 3. Write a program to calculate he sum of odd numbers from 1 to 1000 is 250000 and The sum of even numbers from 1 to 1000 is 250000.
Hint:
We will will appy Q1 and Loop to handle this question.

# # # # #
# # # # #
# # # # #
```
*Command & Hints * 

Your program should use only two output statements, one EACH of the followings:
System.out.print("# ");   // print # and a space, without newline
System.out.println();     // print a newline


* Write a program to print to screen the lines as below:

```

### 6. HarmonicSum (Loop): Write a program called HarmonicSum to compute the sum of a harmonic series, as shown below, where n=50000. The program shall compute the sum from left-to-right as well as from the right-to-left. Obtain the difference between these two sums and explain the difference. Which sum is more accurate?
