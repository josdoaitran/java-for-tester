# JSON Pointer

Let’s take a look at an example. Given the JSON document below, the first element in the likes array would be referred to via the JSON pointer expression: /likes/0.
```
{
    "name": "Duke",
    "likes": [
        "Java",
        "Coffee"
    ]
}
```
The entry API is the JsonPointer interface. An instance is created by calling the static factory method createPointer() on the Json class. The code snippet below creates a JsonPointer and references the second element in the likes array:
```
JsonPointer pointer = Json.createPointer("/likes/0");
```
The JsonPointer API can also mutate the JSON document by adding, replacing, and removing properties. The code snippet below adds the value “Java EE 8” to the likes list:
```
pointer.add(jsonObject, Json.createValue("Java EE 8"));
```
And the code in the following snippet replaces the value at the 3rd index position:
```
pointer = Json.createPointer("/likes/2");
JsonObject newJsonObject = pointer.replace(jsonObject, Json.createValue("Ice Cream"));
```
Putting it all together, you have code that adds an element of the likes array and the replaces an element. The full code snippet looks like this:
```
JsonObject jsonObject = 
    Json.createReader(new StringReader(target)).readObject();
JsonPointer pointer = Json.createPointer("/likes/0");
jsonObject = pointer.add(jsonObject, Json.createValue("Java EE 8"));
pointer = Json.createPointer("/likes/2");
JsonObject newJsonObject = 
    pointer.replace(jsonObject, Json.createValue("Ice Cream"));
```
The output from this code is:
```
{
    "name": "Duke",
    "likes": [
        "Java EE 8",
        "Java",
        "Ice Cream"
    ]
}
```
